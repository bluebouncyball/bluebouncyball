## Hello, I’m @bluebouncyball

- I’m interested in learning more about computer science and working to program

- I am currently learning Python, though I have only had a few months of experience
  
- I’m looking to collaborate on my own personal projects and really focus on seeking professional or higher-level feedback from other programmers
  
- You can reach me through this account
